# Vite + React JavaScript Project Scaffold

This is a simplified scaffold for a ViteJS project using **JavaScript**. To save time and focus on your development, the default content in `App.jsx`, `index.css`, and `App.css` has been deleted. Create a public folder if needed.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── public
│   └── (empty)
├── src
│   ├── App.jsx (empty)
│   ├── main.jsx
│   ├── index.css (empty)
│   └── App.css (empty)
├── .gitignore
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── vite.config.js
└── README.md
```

### Changes Made

- **App.jsx**: This file has been cleared to provide a fresh starting point for your app's component structure. It is still required as the main entry for your React components.
  
- **index.css**: The default styling has been removed. You can add your custom global styles as needed.

- **App.css**: No default styles are present in this file. You can populate it with component-specific styles as you build your app.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open the project in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Adding Your Code

- Start building your app by editing `src/App.jsx`.
- Add your global styles to `src/index.css` and component-specific styles to `src/App.css`.

### Technologies Used

- **ViteJS**: Blazing fast build tool for modern web development.
- **React (JSX)**: Component-based library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript**: The programming language used for this scaffold.
